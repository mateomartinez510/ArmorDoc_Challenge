DEFINITIONS :\\n\"Borrower\" means each person signing at the end of this Note. \"Lender\" means EverBank Reverse Mortgage LLC and its\\nsuccessors and assigns. \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his or her authorized\\nrepresentatives.\\n\\n2. BORROWER\\'S PROMISE TO PAY; INTEREST\\n\\nIn return for amounts to be advanced by Lender up to a maximum principal amount of Four Hundred Seventy Thousand Two\\nHundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($470,250.00), to or for the benefit of Borrower under the terms of a Home Equity\\nConversion Loan Agreement dated August 29, 2008 (\"Loan Agreement\"), Borrower promises to pay to the order of Lender a\\nprincipal amount equal to the sum of all Loan Advances made under the Loan Agreement with interest. All amounts advanced by\\nLender, plus interest, if not paid earlier, are due and payable on July 14, 2087. Interest will be charged on unpaid principal at the\\nrate of Three and 472/1000 percent (3.472%) per year until the full amount of principal has been paid. The interest rate may\\nchange in accordance with Paragraph 5 of this Note. At the end of each month, accrued interest shall be added to and made part of\\nthe principal balance as a Loan Advance and shall likewise thereafter bear interest.\\n\\nThe interest rate required by this Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 5 of this Note is the rate of interest Borrower will pay on the\\noutstanding balance both before and after this Note becomes due and payable as described in Paragraph 7 of this Note, until\\nrepayment in full is made.\\n\\n3. PROMISE TO PAY SECURED\\n\\nBorrower\\'s promise to pay is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust or similar security instrument that is dated the same date as this\\nNote and called the \"Security Instrument.\" The Security Instrument protects the Lender from losses which might result if\\nBorrower defaults under this Note.\\n\\n4, MANNER OF PAYMENT\\n\\n(A) Time\\nBorrower shall pay all outstanding principal and accrued interest to Lender upon receipt of a notice by Lender requiring immediate\\npayment in full, as provided in Paragraph 7 of this Note.\\n\\n(B) Place\\nPayment shall be made at 700 Corporate Blvd., Newburgh, NY 12550 or any such other place as Lender may designate in\\nwriting by notice to Borrower.\\n\\n(C) Limitation of Liability\\n\\nBorrower shall have no personal liability for payment of the debt. Lender shal! enforce the debt only through sale of the Property\\ncovered by the Security Instrument (\"Property\"). If this Note is assigned to the Secretary, the Borrower shall not be liable for any\\ndifference between the mortgage insurance benefits paid to Lender and the outstanding indebtedness, including accrued interest,\\nowed by Borrower at the time of the assignment.\\n\\n5. INTEREST RATE CHANGES\\n\\n(A) Change Date\\nThe interest rate may change on DECEMBER 1, 2008 and on ___ that day of each succeeding year, or _X__ the first day of each\\nsucceeding month. “Change Date” means each date on which the interest rate could change.\\n\\n(B) The Index\\n\\nBeginning with the first Change Date, the interest rate will be based on an Index. “Index\" means the One-Month London\\nInterbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as made available in the \"Money Rates\" section of the Wall Street Journal.. \"Current Index\"\\nmeans the most recent Index figure available 30 days before the Change Date. If the Index (as defined above) is no longer\\navailable, Lender will use as a new Index any index prescribed by the Secretary. Lender will give Borrower notice of the new\\nIndex,\\n\\n(C) Calculation of Interest Rate Changes\\n\\nBefore cach Change Date, Lender will calculate a new interest rate by adding a margin of 1.000 percentage points to the Current\\nIndex. Subject to the limits stated in Paragraph 5(D) of this Note, this amount will be the new interest rate until the next Change\\nDate\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFirst Note\\n\\nTAMPA OEE AAAI Th\\n\\n
